In this exercise you will deal more intensively with the aspects of Open Access and Open Source Software. In practical terms, you will be involved in three small exercise units:

* with openness in scientific publishing by searching and comparing journals (open versus closed) from the GIS field (journals),
* with the openness of research data, in which you search in common data repositories (repositories), and
* with open GIS software to create your own open software alternative for processing our case studies (Software DesktopGIS).
