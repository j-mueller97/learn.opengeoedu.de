> In the [Dresden agreement](http://www.de.digital/DIGITAL/Redaktion/DE/IT-Gipfel/Publikation/2010/it-gipfel-2010-dresdner-vereinbarung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4) on the 5th National IT Summit in December 2010, German politicians committed themselves to pushing ahead by 2013 with the development of a centrally accessible open government platform that meets users' interests in a uniform, easy and user-friendly access, with a focus on the provision of open administrative data. This is intended to network existing data platforms of the federal government, the Länder and local authorities, support further data platforms and meet the requirements of the federal government, the Länder and local authorities as well as the technical quality expectations of the users. This is intended to improve access to administrative data and information and support the further expansion of a process-oriented e-government without media discontinuity (BMI, 2012). The 3rd Geo Progress Report of the Federal Government also explicitly mentions the coexistence of Open Data with nationally developed spatial data infrastructures. <cite>[Federal Government 2012](http://www.de.digital/DIGITAL/Redaktion/DE/IT-Gipfel/Publikation/2010/it-gipfel-2010-dresdner-vereinbarung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4)</cite>
