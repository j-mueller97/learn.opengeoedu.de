## Criteria for open data

In 2010, the [Sunlight Foundation](https://sunlightfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Ten-Principles-for-Opening-Up-Government-Data.pdf) defined ten principles for the openness of government data and updated them in 2014.

1. Completeness
<p>All public data will be made available. Public data is data that is subject to unauthorised data protection, security or access restrictions.</p>

1. Primacy
<p>The data is collected at its origin. This is done with the highest possible degree of granularity, not in aggregated or otherwise modified formats.</p>

1. Timeliness
<p>Data is made available as quickly as necessary to maintain value.</p>

1. Ease of physical and electronic access
<p>Data will be made available to as many users as possible for as many purposes as possible.</p>

1. Machine readability
<p>Data is made available in a structured form for automated processing.</p>

1. Non-discrimination
<p>Data are available to all without prior registration of users.</p>

1. Use of commonly owned standards
<p>Data shall be provided in standardised formats over which no legal person has sole control.</p>

1. Licensing
<p>Data is not subject to copyright, patents, trademarks or trade secrets. Sensible data protection, security and access restrictions are permitted.</p>

1. Permanence
<p>Data are made available permanently, if necessary on the basis of a suitable versioning, i.e. a marking of the data that they correspond only to a certain state.</p>

1. UsageÂ costs
<p>Usage costs should not be an obstacle. They should therefore be kept to a minimum or, whenever possible, free access to the data should be provided.</p>
