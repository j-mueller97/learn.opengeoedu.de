| ethically     |   Data belongs to people. Typical examples: scientific data, data on research   results, statistical data, geodata and others. Research will be funded if   scientific knowledge is freely accessible to all researchers.    |   What costs nothing is worth nothing. The ease with   which data can be accessed and the possibility of authorising changes mean   that there is a risk that the data may be deliberately or unintentionally   falsified. The disclosure of data facilitates its misuse. Examples include   lists of security gaps in IT systems, commercially used evaluations, etc.    |
| financial     |    Public funds have made the generation of data possible in the first place, so they   must also be publicly accessible.                                                                                                    |   The originator of the data is usually interested in the financial success of his   expenses or at least in cost compensation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| copyright     |    Facts may not be subject to copyright.                                                                                                                                                                                    |    Moral claim to copyright.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| economical    |    Free access and use of data free of guidance extends the scope of application of   data, promotes cooperation and increases the benefits for the general public.   It can also be a benefit for the originator.                    |    The author has a right to protect his intellectual property in material and   immaterial respects. There is therefore an innovation protection by trademark   and patent law.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
