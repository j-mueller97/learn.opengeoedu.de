Since OpenGeoEdu mainly deals with the treatment of geodata, two aspects of openness in geodata will be briefly mentioned at this point, which will be further explored in other parts of the course.

* Open Street Map (OSM): Here you will find an extensive geodata stock of in many cases very high quality, which  will be used in various examples.
* Open and interoperable standards (International Standardisation Organisation ISO) and specifications (Open Geospatial Consortium OGC): The world of geospatial information is largely standardised and its use is made possible by services. We also take advantage of this in various places.
