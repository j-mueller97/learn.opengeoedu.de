For the conversion between the individual potential levels (cf. contents below), various conversion factors are required that depend on the selected biomass or conversion technology. Biomass specific properties include, for example 

- *water content* (%) or *dry matter content* (%)
- *calorific value* (e.g. MJ/kgTM)
- *calorific value* (e.g. MJ/kgTM)
- Biogas yield (e.g. NmÂ³/tFM)
- Methane content (vol-% of biogas)

These properties are influenced by a variety of factors and often have bandwidths. For example, the water content of organic material from the brown bin is subject to seasonal and regional fluctuations, as during the vegetation-rich period, especially in rural areas, garden waste is increasingly disposed of in the brown bin (Richter et al. 2017). When converting raw material potentials into fuel or bioenergy potentials, it is therefore important to research and document the framework conditions and the assumed specific properties. In the case of large fluctuations, it may make sense to calculate with bandwidths (min./max.) under certain circumstances.
