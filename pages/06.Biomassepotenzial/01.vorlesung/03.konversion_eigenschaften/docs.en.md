!!!! What are the three types of conversion technologies? <br>
!!!! Which properties can biomasses be characterized by?

Conversion paths for energetic use are manifold and are described below. Raw material properties are important for the choice of the conversion path as well as for the potential calculation, therefore we will briefly discuss them here.
