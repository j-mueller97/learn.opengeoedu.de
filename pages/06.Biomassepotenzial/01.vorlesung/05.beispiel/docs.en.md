!!!! Which core questions and processing steps do you have to consider before calculating a biomass potential? <br>
!!!! Can you transfer the given scheme to other biomasses?

In this chapter, we will show you, using cereal straw as an example, which key questions you need to answer before you can carry out a potential calculation. In order to calculate the technical potential and to be able to make statements about the development of the unused technical potential, these core questions / processing steps are crucial:

- Which individual biomass is taken into account? What type of biomass is it?
- Which restrictions and competing uses must be taken into account?
- Which energetic utilisation pathways for this biomass exist?
- Which factors are necessary to calculate the potential?
- How can the results be cartographically processed in such a way that even laypersons can interpret them well?
