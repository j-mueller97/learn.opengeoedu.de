The possibility of using biomass and, above all, the mobilisation of biogenic resources depends on existing potentials. According to Duden (German dictionary), a **potential** is the totality of all available means, possibilities or abilities. With the help of potential calculations, we want to find answers to the question of how much biomass is available for a specific purpose within a given region and a defined period of time. In order to make the results of such potential calculations comparable and transparent, it is important to define system boundaries, boundary conditions and restrictions that are taken into account in the calculations. With regard to biogenic resources, there are different types and levels of potentials which will be discussed below.
