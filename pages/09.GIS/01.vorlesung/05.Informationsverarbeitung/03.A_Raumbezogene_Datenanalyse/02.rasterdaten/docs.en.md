The example in the figure below shows the application of a simple map algebra operator. It compares the calculated urban pollutant dispersal rates using two different simulation systems. The simulation results of the two models for the near-ground dispersion are available as raster data in a common spatial reference system. Using the map algebra operator LocalDifference, the differences of the two simulation calculations can now be calculated and displayed.
