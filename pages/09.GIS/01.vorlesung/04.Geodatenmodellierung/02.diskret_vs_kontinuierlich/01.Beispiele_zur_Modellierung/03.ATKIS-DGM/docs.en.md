The **Digital Terrain Model** (DTM) of the Official Topographic-Cartographic Information System for the description of the relief (Elevation) is a prominent example of field-based modeling. Points on a regular grid are assigned height values, and from this grid a representation of the terrain surface (e.g. by spatial interpolation) can be derived (see figure).
