!!! Geoinformation describes objects (the so-called geoobjects) of the real world, whereby a spatial reference must be available as an essential element, via which they can be linked together and via which new information can be derived using software functionalities. On and with geoinformation, queries, analyses and evaluations for spatial questions can be carried out. *Geo-information systems (GIS)* are used for this purpose.
