In the exercises you will learn how to start working with geographic information systems and acquire skills in selected processing steps of a GIS, which will be useful for working on the later case studies.

        <strong>Geocoding</strong>
        <p class="text-justify">You want to get a spatial picture of the distribution of a given number of test persons (customers of a company, members of an association, participants in a business event, students in a course of study, etc.). To do this, the address data of the test persons is geocoded, prepared and then cartographically visualized.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-9">
        <strong>Services of general interest</strong>
        <p class="text-justify">Explore your local environment with regard to services of general interest. For example, you could look at the infrastructure in areas such as health, education. Look at leisure time and compare it with current equipment standards. The focus is on simple functions for data preparation and the creation of a thematic map.</p>

        <strong>Weather</strong>
        <p class="text-justify">In addition to the official weather stations of the national weather services, many citizens make the weather data of their home stations available online. Investigate to what extent these data are suitable for supplementing the official weather station network, which is usually very sparsely distributed over the area. In particular, simple statistical measurements should be calculated, time series analysed and interpolation approaches compared.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-9">
        <strong>Particulate matter in large German cities</strong>
        <p class="text-justify">Particulate matter is monitored nationwide by the Federal Environment Agency, with measurements being taken at around 200 measuring stations. These are too few to make a reliable statement about the air quality in cities. Therefore, in this exercise the official measurement data will be enriched with data from privately operated stations such as the openSenseMap project.</p>

        <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong>
        <p class="text-justify">Extensive data collections are openly available on the 17 sustainability goals of the United Nations (UN). Using an indicator, you can evaluate and interpret the situation worldwide. The focus is on simple functions of data preparation and the creation of a thematic map.</p>

Each example results in thematic evaluations in the form of maps, diagrams and assessments, which are compiled in a written document written according to scientific rules.
