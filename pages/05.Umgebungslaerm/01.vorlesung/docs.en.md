### Learning objectives

Environmental noise is a very interesting topic for many spatial study courses. The following questions are to be answered in this module:

* What is noise?
* How many people are affected by ambient environmental noise?
* How can those affected be involved in noise action planning?
* Why is ambient environmental noise calculated instead of measured?
* Which data (formats) are suitable and relevant for the calculation of ambient noise?
* How are these data generated?
* How does the calculation work?
* How can geodata be used to support noise action planning measures?

### Structure of the lecture

The lecture briefly summarises essential aspects of noise, especially in the specific context of the EU Environmental Noise Directive. In the exercise, selected aspects of EU environmental noise mapping will be presented and processed with own data.

* Quiet areas in a municipality
* Rail noise in Germany
* Mobile noise mapping
