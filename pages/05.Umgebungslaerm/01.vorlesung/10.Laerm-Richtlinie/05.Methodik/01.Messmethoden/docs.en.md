The comparability of noise is not only made more difficult by subjective perception. Different weightings and special regulations between the member states also make comparability more difficult.

## Why is ambient noise calculated instead of measured?

The Directive expects the mapping of the continuous sound level at a height of 4&nbsp;metres. Measurements under these conditions are simply not feasible considering the immense effort involved. For the comparative value of the **A-weighted *continuous sound level* for the day, evening and night time** specified in the Directive, measurements would have to be taken in continuous operation, i.e. 365 days over 24 hours (365/24).
