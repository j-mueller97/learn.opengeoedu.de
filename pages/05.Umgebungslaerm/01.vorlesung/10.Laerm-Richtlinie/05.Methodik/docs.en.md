The scope of the survey according to END cannot be achieved with conventional measurement methods, therefore a calculation of the noise exposure is explicitly permitted. Measurement and calculation methods are presented below.

## Expansion of the scope of environmental noise mapping
In the first reporting rounds, environmental noise mappings were requested to a lesser extent or only above a certain traffic volume.

|                            	| 1st reporting round (2005-2009) 	| 2nd reporting round (2010-2014)|
|----------------------------	|--------------------------------	|------------------------------	 |
| **agglomeration**          	| > 250.000 Residents                   	| > 100.000 Residents                 |
| **major road**                | > 6 million cars/year         	| > 3 million cars/year        |
| **major railway line**   	    | > 60.000 trains/year            	| > 30.000 trains/year           |
| **major airport**          	| > 50.000 movements per year      	| > 50.000 movements per year    |

Exposure levels are to be determined on the basis of uniform EU-wide parameters over the entire day (**day-evening-night noise indicator (L<sub>DEN</sub>)**) and separately for the night (**night-time noise indicator (L<sub>Night</sub>)**).
