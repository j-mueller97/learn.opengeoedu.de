What's that, anyway? 

> Noise is any type of sound that can disturb, annoy, or impair a person's health. <cite>[World Health Organisation, 2000](http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/43316/E92845.pdf)</cite>


How loud a sound is perceived depends on the following factors:

* the sound pressure level,
* the type of sound (sound or tone) and
* the pitch (frequency).

Depending on the listener and his perception of sounds, the same sound sources are perceived differently loud and/or annoying. [The transmission of the stimuli depends on the modulation of the sound](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Loudness_perception.webm).

> **Lärm ist das Geräusch der anderen.** <br> *Noise is the sound of others.* <cite>Kurt Tucholsky</cite>

Sound becomes noise if it causes disturbances, nuisances, impairments or damage.

Strong noise exposure can have health consequences. Noise-induced hearing loss, which is a direct damage to the hearing (= aural effect), should be mentioned here as a proven fact. Long-term exposure to average sound pressure levels of more than 80 dB(A) (related to a 40 hour week) leads to an increase in the risk of damage to the inner ear in the form of irreversible hearing loss. <cite>[Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety](https://www.lgl.bayern.de/gesundheit/arbeitsplatz_umwelt/physikalische_umweltfaktoren/laerm_grundlagen.htm)</cite>
