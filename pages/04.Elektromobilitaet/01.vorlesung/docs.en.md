## Learning objectives 
!!!! The aim of the learning unit is to get to know the framework conditions for electro mobility, to classify this current society topic and to work out questions that can be investigated with open geodata. 

## Structure of the Lecture
Electro mobility is a very heavily discussed topic and the emerging industry shows clear development potential. The lecture deals fundamentally with the topic of electro mobility and presents the current situation, e.g. regarding the charging station infrastructure as well as obstacles in increasing the number of electric cars.

## Contents of the exercises

The exercises will address the question of how and which issues can be addressed with open geodata in the context of electro mobility. Of course, the focus here is on spatial aspects in particular. For this purpose, several exemplary questions are offered. Each example results in thematic evaluations in the form of maps, diagrams, evaluations, which have to be compiled in a written document according to the rules of science.
