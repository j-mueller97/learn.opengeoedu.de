Electro mobility is, as has been explained, an up-to-date topic overall and the emerging industry shows clear development potential. How can issues in the context of electro mobility be dealt with using open geodata? Of course, the focus here is on spatial aspects in particular.

Three essential factors will influence the success of electro mobility in the future from the buyer's point of view:
- the price of electric vehicles (total costs),
- the range of the electric vehicle and associated with it and
- the availability of publicly accessible charging infrastructure.


While open geodata use will have little impact on pricing, the other two factors are spatial criteria, so that interesting aspects with open geodata and GIS analysis can arise. Therefore, our practical work focuses on the range and the charging infrastructure in our examples. The evaluations include accessibility analyses, airline distances, bivariate statistics and routing.
The result is a thematic evaluation in the form of maps, diagrams and evaluations, which are compiled in a written document according to the rules of science.
