From a political point of view, there are a large number of legal regulations that favour electro mobility, as well as national targets for the introduction of electro mobility. In order to achieve these goals, there are various direct and indirect funding instruments.
- Legal framework: The EU regulation on CO2 emissions from vehicle fleets forms an overarching political framework for the promotion of electro mobility from an ecological point of view. "This Regulation establishes standards for CO2 emissions from new passenger cars. The regulation sets an average emission [across all vehicles of a manufacturer registered in the EU] of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometre [from 2012]. From 2020, this value must be reduced to 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre". (EC 2010) In September 2014, the Federal Cabinet passed an Electric Mobility Act to support the market launch of electric vehicles (EmoG 2014).
- Obligation to label vehicles: When vehicles are sold, consumption (urban and interurban, as well as in litres, cubic metres or kilowatt-hours depending on vehicle type) and CO2 efficiency are stated in relation to mass (BMWi 2011) in order to increase transparency.
- Financial incentive systems: There is a tax exemption for a period of ten years and a change in company car taxation. Since 2016, buyers have received purchase premiums of 4000 (now up to 6000) Euros for electric cars and 3000 (til 5000) Euros for plug-in hybrid cars. Electricity used to operate electric vehicles is not subject to mineral oil tax. Energy supply companies (EVU) additionally offer various subsidies.
