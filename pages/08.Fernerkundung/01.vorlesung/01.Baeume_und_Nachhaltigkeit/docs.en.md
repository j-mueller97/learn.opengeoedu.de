## Trees and sustainability

The motivation for our learning units lies in the sustainability concept in general and in specific aspects:
+ the role of forests on a global and local level,
+ the importance of urban trees and urban development

The focus will be on forest monitoring with the help of satellites and the recording of trees and green spaces in an urban context. Free geodata will be used for this purpose.
