In the exercises, you will learn how to get started working with landscape metrics and acquire skills in selected processing steps and analysis methods. The exercises cover the following topics:

* Introduction to the basics
* Neighbourhood Analysis
* Landscape diversity
* Fragmentation of the landscape

In addition, a data set on a larger landscape section is provided for an independent, more comprehensive landscape analysis.

As a result of each example, thematic evaluations are produced in the form of maps, diagrams and assessments, which are compiled for each individual exercise in a written document written according to the rules of science.
