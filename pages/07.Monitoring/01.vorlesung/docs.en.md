The Leibniz Institute for Ecological Regional Development (IÖR) is a non-university research center on spatial sciences, which is a member of the Leibniz Association in Germany. IÖR develops scientific foundations for the sustainable development and transformation of cities as well as regions in a national and international context. IÖR is dealing with the questions of monitoring settlement and open space development, in addition to landscape change and management, resource efficiency of settlement structures and environmental risks in urban and regional development. The thematic topics can be highlighted as automated data-driven approaches of collection, monitoring, analysis, visualisation and evaluation for the spatial dimensions of land use structures, building stock and transport infrastructure and their development.</p>
