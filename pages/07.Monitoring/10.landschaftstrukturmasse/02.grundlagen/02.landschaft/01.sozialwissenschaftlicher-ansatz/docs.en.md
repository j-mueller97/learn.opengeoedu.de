!!! "Landscape is an area, as perceived by humans, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors". (European Landscape Convention 2000, Article 1a)

The human being thus takes on a central role. But this also means that landscape is thus perceived differently by each individual. What exactly landscape is, every person has a different "picture" in his head.
