Landscape structure is the composition of different elements of the landscape. An element can be determined according to different criteria. Depending on the research question, a landscape element can, for example, describe a specific land use (see Fig. 2) or clearly delimitable landscape forms. The smallest homogeneous landscape element is called **patch**.

Since a landscape always consists of several patches, depending on the viewing level, their position in relation to each other is also a part of the landscape structure. On the one hand, it is the composition of different patches and the arrangement of the patches that makes up the landscape structure or gives a concrete landscape its characteristics. On the other hand, the composition and arrangement of the patches have an influence on which processes take place in a landscape and how they interact. This in turn can also lead to new structures in the landscape.

Therefore, it should be noted that the totality of the patches of a landscape and their relationship to each other describes a **landscape structure**. Essentially, the recording of the landscape structure is about the pattern that is visible when looking from above ("horizontal structure").

The _horizontal structure_ describes the planar spatial structure of elements in a landscape. It is used in most cases in the calculation of landscape metrics.

In Fig. 3 the different horizontal landscape structures are clearly visible. In Iowa the landscape structure is very ordered (regular), whereas in Germany and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania the landscape structure appears rather disordered.
