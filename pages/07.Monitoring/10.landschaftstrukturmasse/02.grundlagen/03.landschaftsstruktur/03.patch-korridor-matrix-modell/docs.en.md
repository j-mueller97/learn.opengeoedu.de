The patch corridor matrix model describes the horizontal landscape structure, which consists of differently adjacent landscape elements (land uses, soil types, vegetation types, etc.). Here, the landscape is thus viewed from a "bird's eye view" (see Fig. 5).

The following explanations of terms are given (see also Fig. 6):
* _Patch:_ Individual landscape elements embedded in the matrix (e.g. hedges, settlements, woods)
* _Corridor:_ linear, connecting elements (e.g. river network)
* _Matrix:_ A predominant type of use (e.g. forest)
