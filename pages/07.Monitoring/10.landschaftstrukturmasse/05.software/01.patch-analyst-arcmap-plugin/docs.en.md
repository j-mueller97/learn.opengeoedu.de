The Patch Analyst is a plugin for the Esri product ArcMap in version 10.x. It is primarily possible to analyze vector data with this plugin. Raster data can either be converted into vector data or the plugin Patch Grid is used. The heart of the plugin are the Spatial Statistics, with which it is possible to calculate landscape metrics from vector data.

In the Patch Analyst the common landscape metrics are offered (see Fig. 12). You can choose between a class-based or landscape-based analysis. Additionally the extension offers possibilities for data preparation.

In summary, the Patch Analyst is a good choice for owners of an ArcMap license.
