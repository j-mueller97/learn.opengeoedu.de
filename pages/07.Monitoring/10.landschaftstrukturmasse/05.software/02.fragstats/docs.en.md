FRAGSTATS is a stand alone software which was first published in 1995. It offers a wide range of calculations of landscape metrics based on raster data. The calculations can be exported as table (.patch) and as raster file (.tif). The table can later be converted to a csv file and imported into Excel or GIS software.

The analyses are divided here into three areas:

* Patch metrics
* Class metrics
* Landscape metrics

In summary, Fragstats offers many possibilities in the calculation of landscape metrics and is especially recommended for raster data.
