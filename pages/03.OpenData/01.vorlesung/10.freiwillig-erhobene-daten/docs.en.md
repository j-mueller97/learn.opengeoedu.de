A large amount of free geodata used today is derived from non-profit projects, often based on citizens' initiatives and voluntary work, but sometimes also involving businesses, public authorities and research institutions.

A characteristic feature of many of these projects is so-called **crowdsourcing**, i.e. that important tasks, in particular data collection, depend on the participation of volunteers, e.g. via the Internet. Rarely are the works of individuals involved.

Global projects such as [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (the free world map), [GADM](https://gadm.org) (global administrative areas), [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) (small-scale vector and raster data of the earth) and [Geonames](https://www.geonames.org/) (geographical place names) deal with the provision of map data.

Under the term **Citizen Science**, scientific projects are carried out by interested laymen. Within the framework of [Luftdaten.info](https://luftdaten.info/), [Openair.Cologne](https://openair.cologne) und [OpenSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/]), for example, air data (e.g. temperature, humidity, fine dust, nitrogen oxides) are collected with the help of simple sensors, evaluated and made publicly available. The project [blitzortung.org](http://de.blitzortung.org) uses receiving stations to locate lightning and thunderstorms worldwide in real time.

! Many more examples of Citizen Science projects and crowdsourcing are listed in the [Wiki of Forschungsdaten.org](http://www.forschungsdaten.org/index.php/Citizen_Science).
