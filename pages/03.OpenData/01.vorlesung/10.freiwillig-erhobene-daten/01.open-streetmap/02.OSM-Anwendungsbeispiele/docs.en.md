OpenStreetMap data is already very extensive and detailed in many parts of the world, including the DACH region. Openness and cooperation between government and society also make hybrid data products possible, for example from OpenStreetMap and governmental data, which represent additional added value for the public.

## Open regional map MV (ORKa.MV)

The Open Regional Map Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (ORKa.MV) is an open map service from the administration (OpenGovData) in which cadastral data and OpenStreetMap data are combined. The ORKa.MV was realized by the administrative districts and independent towns in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (LkKfS-MV), the project is supervised and hosted by the cadastral, surveying and real estate office of the Hanseatic city of Rostock (https://www.orka-mv.de).
