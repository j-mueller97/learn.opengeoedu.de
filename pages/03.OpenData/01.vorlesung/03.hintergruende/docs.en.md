In our society there is nothing new about the demand that ideas, knowledge, information and data should be freely accessible to the public.

It is important to recognize that the Open Data movement is the result of several social discourses in which interest groups with different goals are involved. It is a global phenomenon, fostered by digital networking and international cooperation.
